# Klan Energy — Enhanced Starter (with Logo)

This package includes the Enhanced Klan Energy starter project with a simple SVG logo in the `assets` folders.

## Quick steps to add this to GitHub (no terminal needed)

### Option A — Upload via GitHub web (Drag & Drop)
1. Go to https://github.com/new and create a new repository named **klanenergy** under your account **stancodes2**.
2. After creation, on the repo page click **Add file → Upload files**.
3. Drag the entire contents of this ZIP (or the extracted folder) into the browser area. (You can upload folder contents by dragging files). 
4. Commit the changes at the bottom of the page.
5. Your files will now be in `https://github.com/stancodes2/klanenergy` and you can import it into Replit via https://replit.com/import by pasting that URL.

### Option B — Using Replit Bash (if you prefer terminal)
1. Create a new Repl using **Bash**.
2. Upload this ZIP to the left file pane in Replit.
3. In the Replit terminal, run:
   ```bash
   unzip klanenergy_enhanced.zip
   cd klanenergy_enhanced
   # Create a new GitHub repo on the website first, then copy the HTTPS URL below
   git init
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/stancodes2/klanenergy.git
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial enhanced Klan Energy starter with logo"
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   Note: Pushing requires you to authenticate with GitHub (use a personal access token if prompted).
